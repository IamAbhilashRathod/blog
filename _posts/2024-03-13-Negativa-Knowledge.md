The knowledge of "what not do"
An approach of adding value by removing things, instead of adding things

Put simply, its "improving by subtraction"

Want to be healthy? before you go all Arnold Schwarzenegger by joining the premium membership of your closest gym, cut out that "Toofani" sugary drinks from your diet

Want to be Rich? before you invest half of your net worth on that "guaranteed profit" stock your friend suggested, try not living paycheck to paycheck

Want to be more at peace? before joining that 7 day meditation camp, try cutting out things that take away your peace (if you are married and have kids, you can ignore this one)

Instead of trying to define what a perfect partner should be like, try defining what you definitely dont want in a spouse

Its easier to know what you dont want than what you want

Its more reliable to know the "donts" than to know the "dos"

Adding 10 pushups to your workout routine will not increase your health levels as much as cutting out 2 cigarettes will do

Instead of deciding what you should invest in, first try cutting out everything you shouldnt touch

By downsizing the universe, removing all the "bad" investments that you shouldnt make what you are actually doing is setting yourself on a path where you are less and less likely to make an investment that pose a risk of ruin

Below are just some people and their own version of the negative knowledge
## Nassim Taleb's "Via Negativa"
> **_Via negativa: In theology and philosophy, the focus on what something is not, an indirect definition. In action, it is a recipe for what to avoid, what not to do—subtraction, not addition, say, in medicine._**

## Charlie Munger's "Inversion"

## Naval Ravikant's "To make good decisions, avoid bad ones"

> **_I don’t believe I have the ability to say what is going to work. Rather, I try to eliminate what’s not going to work. I think being successful is just about not making mistakes. It’s not about having correct judgment. It’s about avoiding incorrect judgments._**

Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance

Until next time !
